        Thanks for taking the time to file a bug report!

        **Please note:**
        1. General usage questions are not bug reports. If you're looking for support with your train, you can consider asking for help on the [community](https://docs.swanlab.cn/guide_cloud/community/online-support.html) instead.
        2. `swanlab` can be integrated into other AI training frameworks, therefore bugs in other frameworks might cause errors in training that use `swanlab`. Please make sure that the bug you're experiencing is _caused by_ by `swanlab`.
        3. If your issue appears to be network-related, you might want to [Report a network-related problem](https://github.com/SwanHubX/SwanLab/issues/new/choose) instead.
        4. Bug reports without a reproduction may be closed immediately.
