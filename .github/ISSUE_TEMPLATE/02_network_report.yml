        Thanks for reporting a network issue!

        **Critical Notes for Network Issues:**
        1. Network problems often involve local environment (proxies, firewalls), server status, or client configs. Please provide detailed context.
        2. Ensure the issue is SwanLab-specific: e.g., you can access [https://swanlab.cn](https://swanlab.cn) via a browser, but SwanLab SDK fails.
        3. Include network test results (ping/traceroute/curl) and raw error logs.
        4. Reports without sufficient network details may be closed temporarily.

        **Why This Matters:**
        Network issues require context about your environment and connectivity. Logs like `curl -v` or `traceroute` help us distinguish between client misconfigurations, proxy blocks, or server-side problems. Thank you for your patienceâ€”weâ€™ll prioritize resolving this once we have enough details!
